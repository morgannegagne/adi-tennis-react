    <h3>League Info</h3>
    <p>The Analog Devices Wilmington winter tennis league was started back around 1982.</p>
    <p>
      It has grown and evolved over that time to its current status of 24 players playing in four
      leagues, grouped according to ability. The leagues are designated B, C, and D, with the better
      players playing in B league. Abilities range from beginner to intermediate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Play takes place at the Woburn Racquet club on Tuesday and Thursday mornings from 6:30AM to
      7:30AM. Each player will play one of those mornings depending on which day the schedule
      assigns him to play for that week. League play runs from about the first week in September to
      about the second week in May.
    </p>

    <p>The format is doubles, and one ten game set is played.</p>

    <p>
      The schedule is set up for a period of seven weeks. During that time, each player in a given
      league will play with each other player in the league once, and against each other player in
      the league twice. Points are awarded for the number of games won, and standings are kept by
      one of the players in the league. At the end of the seven weeks, the top two players in C, D,
      and E leagues will move up a league, while the bottom two players in B, C, and D leagues will
      move down a league. This allows players to move up and down in the league according to their
      ability, and it also keeps the competition balanced. At the end of the seven weeks, a new
      schedule is then issued, and competition starts anew.
