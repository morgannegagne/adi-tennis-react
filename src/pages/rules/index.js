    <h3>League Rules and Regulations</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Each match will consist of one set, using standard scoring, with the first team to win 10
        games winning the set.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the first team wins five games, teams will swap sides of the net, and each team will
        have the option of changing the order of receiving serve at their first opportunity to do
        so. If it is not changed at that time, then it will remain the same for the remainder of the
        match.
      </li>

      <li>
        If necessary, a 12-point (first to 7 - win by 2) tiebreaker will be played at nine games
        all. First player serves one point from the right court. Players then serve two points each,
        in turn, starting from the left court.
      </li>

      <li>
        Each player on the winning team will receive ten points plus a bonus of the difference
        between the number of games won by each team. For example, each player on a team winning
        10-4 would receive 16 points.
      </li>

      <li>
        Each player on the losing team will receive points equal to the number of games that they
        win.
      </li>

      <li>
        If a player cannot make a match, he should arrange for a substitute. The substitute must be
        the closest available player, points wise, in the standings. If none of the other four
        players can sub, then the person needing the sub may try to reschedule the match for another
        day that week, either by swapping the Tuesday and Thursday matches, or by booking and paying
        for another court. All other players affected must agree to the rescheduling.
      </li>

      <li>
        In the event of a substitute on the winning team, no bonus points will be awarded to the
        player being substituted for.
      </li>

      <li>
        Any player who does not show up by 6:45 will be declared a no-show. If a player should
        no-show twice in the same segment, or three times in the same contract season, that player
        will be dropped to the bottom of the waiting list. Players who have shown up for a match
        which cannot be played because of a no show will be awarded 13 points.
      </li>

      <li>Five minutes will be allotted for warm-up. Play should start no later than 6:40.</li>

      <li>
        If a match that started on time cannot be completed, each team will be awarded a like number
        of games until the total of one or both teams equals 10 games.
      </li>

      <li>
        If a player arrives between 6:40 and 6:45, then play should start immediately. If the match
        cannot be finished, it will be treated as in rule number 10, except the player who arrives
        late gets credit only for the number of games he has won.
      </li>

      <li>
        If a player leaves before 7:30, and the match is not complete, or if a player has to stop
        due to injury before the match is complete, then each team will be awarded a like number of
        games until the total of one or both teams equals 10. The player who cannot complete the
        match will get credit only for the number of games he has won.
      </li>

      <li>
        If a court is available, and all players agree, play may continue past 7:30 in order to
        complete the match. A player who has to leave at 7:30 must say so before the match begins,
        and may not continue playing after 7:30. If a player leaves at 7:30 without having given
        notification at the beginning of the match, the score will be treated as in rule number 10,
        except the player who leaves gets credit only for the number of games he has won.
      </li>

      <li>
        If a match is not playable, (due to weather, problems at the club, etc.) then the other
        match that week will not count in the standings, unless the missed match is made up. Any
        weeks that do not count may be rescheduled to make up matches.
      </li>

      <li>
        The clock on court 4 will be the official time for courts 4 and higher. The clock on court 3
        will be the official time for courts 1 through 3.
      </li>

      <li>
        A group of eight players will constitute a league. Leagues will be identified by letters,
        with closeness to the beginning of the alphabet indicating higher level players.
      </li>

      <li>
        At the end of each segment, the bottom two players from all leagues except the lowest league
        will drop down one league. The top two players from all leagues except the highest league
        will move up one league. The master schedule will remain the same, but the entire eight
        players will be redrawn at random in order to assign new letters.
      </li>

      <li>
        At the end of each segment, the player in fifth place will take over the responsibility of
        collecting the scores and issuing the weekly results and standings sheets for the next
        segment. The sheets for any week should be issued no later than Monday of the following
        week. The preferred format is two lines showing the results of the previous week, and a
        table showing each players points on a week by week basis as well as the total points, with
        the table arranged in order of total points.
      </li>

      <li>
        At the end of each segment, the player in sixth place will take over responsibility of
        handing out the tennis balls for the next segment. The balls should be given out no later
        than Monday of the week in which the matches will be played. The balls may be given out
        earlier at the ballperson's convenience. Do not make the players come to you for the balls.
      </li>

      <li>
        The only exceptions to rule 20 will be if the player does not work at the location where at
        least half of the players in his/her league work. In this case, if the fifth place player
        does work at that location, they will exchange responsibilities. If both fifth and sixth
        place do not work there, then the next player above fifth place who does work there will
        assume the ball responsibility, and the sixth place player will do the scoring.
      </li>

      <li>
        The capitalized letters in the schedules indicate three things:
        <ol>
          <li>
            The player responsible for bringing the balls to the match (see the ball person if he
            has not given them to you by Monday).
          </li>
          <li>The player who keeps the used balls.</li>

          <li>
            The player responsible for reporting the score and any substitutes or no shows to the
            scorekeeper. Do not make the scorekeeper chase you.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        A player returning to the league will be permitted to start in the next lower league from
        where he would have played his next match. He must give notice at least four weeks before
        the end of a segment of his intention to do this. In order to provide room for him to enter
        there, only the first place finisher from the leagues below where he enters will move up at
        the end of the segment.
      </li>
    </ol>
